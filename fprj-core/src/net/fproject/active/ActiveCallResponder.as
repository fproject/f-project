	/**
	 *  This component helps you manage the results for asynchronous calls made from
	 *  ActiveService and binding those result with an IActiveDataProvider.
	 *  While each individual service
	 *  and operation dispatches result and fault events, it is common to need to use the
	 *  same operation in different parts of your application.  Using one event listener
	 *  or lastResult value across the entire application can be awkward.  Rather than creating
	 *  two service components which refer to the same service, you can use a simple lightweight
	 *  IActiveDataProvider to manage the event listeners and lastResult value for a specific invocation
	 *  of a service.
	 *  <p>
	 *  You set the token property of this component to the AsyncToken returned by the 
	 *  service.  You can then add event listeners on this component instead of having to
	 *  add them to each AsyncToken returned.   This component also maintains the
	 *  lastResult property which is a copy of the value returned by the last successful
	 *  result event dispatched by a token monitored by this service.  Though you can
	 *  bind to either the <code>callResponder.token.result</code> or 
	 *  <code>callResponder.lastResult</code>, the latter will be preserved while a second
	 *  call to the same service is in progress while the former will be reset as soon
	 *  as a new service invocation is started.
	 *  </p>
